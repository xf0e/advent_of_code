    "The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. \"The printer's broken! We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!\" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. \"We have a big problem,\" she says; \"there must be almost fifty bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars, you'll be able to--\" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: 25 milliseconds until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all fifty stars by December 25th.\n",

    "Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day millisecond in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n",

    "It goes on to explain that you may only leave by solving a captcha to prove you're not a human. Apparently, you only get one millisecond to solve the captcha: too fast for a normal human, but it feels like hours to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.\n",
    "    1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.\n",
    "    1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.\n",
    "    91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit, 9.\n",

    "Now, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the digit halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10 items, only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward matches it. Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1212 produces 6: the list contains 4 items, and all four digits match the digit 2 items ahead.\n",
    "    1221 produces 0, because every comparison is between a 1 and a 2.\n",
    "    123425 produces 4, because both 2s match each other, but no other digit has a match.\n",
    "    123123 produces 12.\n",
    "    12131415 produces 4.\n",

    "A debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks. The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen for redistribution.\n",
    "    Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.\n",
    "    Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.\n",
    "    Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.\n",
    "    The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.\n",
    "    The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?\n",
    "--- Part Two ---\n",

    "Out of curiosity, the debugger would also like to know the size of the loop: starting from a state that has already been seen, how many block redistribution cycles must be performed before that same state is seen again?\n",

    "The logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\n",

    "65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\n",
