    "This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and\n",
    "bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the\n",
    "recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.\n",
    "Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a\n",
    "16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each\n",
    "wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can\n",
    "only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to\n",
    "multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its\n",
    "inputs have a signal.\n",
    "The included instructions booklet describe how to connect the parts\n",
    "together: x AND y -> z means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate,\n",
    "and then connect its output to wire z.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- \"123 -> x\" means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.\n",
    "- \"x AND y -> z\" means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is\n",
    "  provided to wire z.\n",
    "- \"p LSHIFT 2 -> q\" means that the value from wire p is left-shifted\n",
    "  by 2 and then provided to wire q.\n",
    "- \"NOT e -> f\" means that the bitwise complement of the value from\n",
    "  wire e is provided to wire f.\n",
    "Other possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT\n",
    "(right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit\n",
    "instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript,\n",
    "or Python) provide operators for these gates.\n",
    "For example, here is a simple circuit:\n",
    "    123 -> x\n",
    "    456 -> y\n",
    "    x AND y -> d\n",

    "\n",
    "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick! His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.\n",
    "\n",
    "The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:\n",
    "\n",
    "H => HO\n",
    "H => OH\n",
    "O => HH\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "    HOOH (via H => HO on the first H).\n",
    "    HOHO (via H => HO on the second H).\n",
    "    OHOH (via H => OH on the first H).\n",
    "    HOOH (via H => OH on the second H).\n",
    "    HHHH (via O => HH).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?\n",
    "\n",
    "--- Part Two ---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have the following replacements:\n",
    "\n",
    "e => H\n",
    "e => O\n",
    "H => HO\n",
    "H => OH\n",
    "O => HH\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to make HOH, you start with e, and then make the following replacements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    e => O to get O\n",
    "    O => HH to get HH\n",
    "    H => OH (on the second H) to get HOH\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you could make HOH after 3 steps. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can be made in 6 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "How long will it take to make the medicine? Given the available replacements and the medicine molecule in your puzzle input, what is the fewest number of steps to go from e to the medicine molecule?\n"

For example, jmp +1 would simply continue with the next instruction, while jmp +0 would continuously jump back to itself forever.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's Christmas Eve, and Santa is loading up the sleigh for this year's deliveries. However, there's one small problem: he can't get the sleigh to balance. If it isn't balanced, he can't defy physics, and nobody gets presents this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "No pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Santa has provided you a list of the weights of every package he needs to fit on the sleigh. The packages need to be split into three groups of exactly the same weight, and every package has to fit. The first group goes in the passenger compartment of the sleigh, and the second and third go in containers on either side. Only when all three groups weigh exactly the same amount will the sleigh be able to fly. Defying physics has rules, you know!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, that's not the only problem. The first group - the one going in the passenger compartment - needs as few packages as possible so that Santa has some legroom left over. It doesn't matter how many packages are in either of the other two groups, so long as all of the groups weigh the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Santa tells you, if there are multiple ways to arrange the packages such that the fewest possible are in the first group, you need to choose the way where the first group has the smallest quantum entanglement to reduce the chance of any \"complications\". The quantum entanglement of a group of packages is the product of their weights, that is, the value you get when you multiply their weights together. Only consider quantum entanglement if the first group has the fewest possible number of packages in it and all groups weigh the same amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have ten packages with weights 1 through 5 and 7 through 11. For this situation, some of the unique first groups, their quantum entanglements, and a way to divide the remaining packages are as follows:\n",
