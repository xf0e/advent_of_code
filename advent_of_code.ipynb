    "This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and\n",
    "bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the\n",
    "recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.\n",
    "Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a\n",
    "16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each\n",
    "wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can\n",
    "only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to\n",
    "multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its\n",
    "inputs have a signal.\n",
    "The included instructions booklet describe how to connect the parts\n",
    "together: x AND y -> z means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate,\n",
    "and then connect its output to wire z.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- \"123 -> x\" means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.\n",
    "- \"x AND y -> z\" means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is\n",
    "  provided to wire z.\n",
    "- \"p LSHIFT 2 -> q\" means that the value from wire p is left-shifted\n",
    "  by 2 and then provided to wire q.\n",
    "- \"NOT e -> f\" means that the bitwise complement of the value from\n",
    "  wire e is provided to wire f.\n",
    "Other possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT\n",
    "(right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit\n",
    "instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript,\n",
    "or Python) provide operators for these gates.\n",
    "For example, here is a simple circuit:\n",
    "    123 -> x\n",
    "    456 -> y\n",
    "    x AND y -> d\n",
